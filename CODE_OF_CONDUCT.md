# ❤️ Code of Conduct ❤️

## Our Pledge
In the interest of fostering an open, welcoming, and inclusive community, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, sexual identity and orientation, or any other distinguishing factor.

We celebrate diversity and commit to creating a safe space for all, where everyone feels welcome, valued, and loved! 🌈


## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contribute to creating a positive environment include:
- Using welcoming and inclusive language 🤗
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences 👂
- Gracefully accepting constructive feedback 💬
- Focusing on what is best for the community 🌍
- Showing empathy and kindness towards other community members 💖

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances 🚫
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks ❌
- Public or private harassment 🛑
- Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission 🔐
- Any other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting


## Our Responsibilities
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and to temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.


## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of the project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.


## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at [contact@thenolle.com](mailto:contact@thenolle.com). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project’s leadership.
